Issue Summary:

On May 12, 2023, our social media platform experienced a catastrophic meltdown that left 70% of our users feeling as lost as a cat in a room full of rocking chairs. Between 2:00 PM and 5:00 PM EST, users were unable to access their feeds or post new content, leaving them with nothing to do but stare at their screens and wonder if they should go outside and see what this "real world" thing is all about.

Timeline:

- 2:00 PM: Our monitoring system raised the alarm, alerting our on-call engineer faster than a cat chasing a laser pointer.
- 2:05 PM: Our engineer noticed the database was slower than a snail carrying a heavy backpack and began investigating.
- 2:15 PM: The engineer attempted to restart the database server, but it was as unresponsive as a teenager being asked to do the dishes.
- 2:20 PM: The engineer reached out to the database team, who were as busy as a one-armed wallpaper hanger, and began investigating other parts of the system.
- 2:30 PM: The database team detected an issue with the primary database server, which was as broken as a unicorn with a broken horn. They tried to failover to the secondary server.
- 2:40 PM: The failover was successful, but the secondary server was as confused as a chameleon in a bag of Skittles and wasn't properly synced with the primary, causing inconsistencies in the data.
- 3:00 PM: Our engineering team began working harder than a one-legged man in a butt-kicking contest to restore the data.
- 4:30 PM: The issue was resolved, and our users rejoiced like kids on Christmas morning.

Root cause and resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a hardware failure on the primary database server, which caused a ripple effect throughout the system. The resolution involved failing over to the secondary server and restoring data from backups, which was as complex as a Rubik's cube in the hands of a toddler.

To prevent future issues, we will be implementing better monitoring and alerting for hardware failures, as well as improving our failover processes to ensure that secondary servers are properly synced with primaries. We'll also review and update our disaster recovery plans as needed because you can never be too prepared.

Corrective and preventative measures:

- Create additional monitoring and alerting for hardware failures, because sometimes you need a neon sign to tell you when something's wrong.
- Improve failover processes to ensure proper syncing of secondary servers, because you can't have one server living in the past while the other is living in the future.
- Conduct regular backups and test data restoration processes, because you never know when you'll need to restore from a backup, like when you accidentally delete your entire music collection.
- Review disaster recovery plans and update them as necessary, because the only thing worse than not having a plan is having one that doesn't work.
- Conduct post-mortem analysis and document lessons learned for future reference, because if you don't learn from your mistakes, you're doomed to repeat them. Plus, it's always good to have a good laugh at yourself once in a while.
